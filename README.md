# Liminal Escape

Liminal Escape is a Backrooms style liminal space psychological horror game developed by the owner of this repository, Christopher Windrow.
# Core Concepts 
Liminal Escape features many renowned backrooms levels. These levels 
draw from the Backrooms Wiki, Kane Pixels, r/LiminalSpaces, and those who send in images in which encapsulate the idea of Liminality.
With procedurally generated levels, unique puzzles, and entities spanning across multiple playscapes, liminal escape strives its best to 
hold the true presence of liminal spaces without the need of "see entity run from entity". We pull inspiration from SCP for these entities to help spike that survival horror to player engagement while preserving these spaces.
We also feature a inventory system with inspiration from the fallout series and a sanity system which is not too stressful on the player but finds a balance between being too "annoying" and to "non-existent".

# Roadmap
With a release planned in October 25'. You can find gameplay updates in our discord. Liminal Escape will feature a good sum of levels at launch with a planned price of 5.99-7.99. 
A form will be required for play testing. The game will be released in early access and once "complete" will receive many updates for the livelihood with the ultimate goal of being player base driven after launch

# What if I'm a speedrunner?
Wonderful. We want to keep the integrity of speed running backrooms games for those and offer a feature of game modes. First off we will have a speedrun mode.
This mode will feature shorter levels with objectives for speed running and even some in-game purposeful glitches that are time-dependent .
If you want to play the game normally you can as well. Speedrunning is welcome across all modes whether it's Liminal (no monsters), Easy, Medium, Hard, or Unbroken.
